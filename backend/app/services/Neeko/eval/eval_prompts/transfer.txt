[Evaluation Criterion]
Transfer (1-7): Does the AI assistant seamlessly transition between different roles, maintaining consistency and authenticity in each character portrayal?

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Review the interactions between the AI assistant and the user, focusing on instances where the AI switches between different characters.
2. Assess the transitions between roles to determine if the AI maintains consistency and authenticity in each character portrayal. Look for smooth shifts in dialogue style, language usage, and personality traits that align with the characteristics of each character.
3. Evaluate whether the AI effectively captures the essence of each character, ensuring that their responses reflect their historical or fictional background, personality traits, and mannerisms.
4. Rate the performance of the AI on a scale of 1-7 for Transfer, where 1 represents a poor transition with inconsistencies in character portrayal, and 7 represents seamless transitions with each character authentically represented throughout the conversation. Assign a higher score for responses that demonstrate clear distinctions between characters and maintain consistency in their portrayal, and a lower score for instances of ambiguity or inconsistency in character transitions.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.
