You will be given responses written by an AI assistant mimicking the character {agent_name}. Your task is to rate the performance of {agent_name} using the specific criterion by following the evaluation steps. Below is the data:

***
[Profile]
{agent_context}

[Background]
Location: {loc_time}
Status: {status}
***
[Interactions]
{interactions}
***
[Evaluation Criterion]
Real Knowledge Correctness (1-7): Is the response free from conflicts with the real-world knowledge?

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read through the interactions and identify the key points related to the real-world knowledge.
2. Read through the responses of the AI assistant and compare them to real-world knowledge. Check if the responses align with facts, events, and information that are generally accepted as true in the real world.
3. Evaluate whether the responses demonstrate a clear understanding of real-world concepts and provide accurate information. Look for any instances where the AI may have provided information that contradicts established facts or where it lacks accuracy in representing real-world knowledge.
4. Rate the performance of the AI on a scale of 1-7 for real knowledge correctness, where 1 is the lowest and 7 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criterion. Assign a higher score for responses that consistently align with real-world knowledge and a lower score for those with noticeable discrepancies or inaccuracies.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.
