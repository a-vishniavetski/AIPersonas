You will be given responses written by an AI assistant mimicing the character {agent_name}. Your task is to rate the performance of {agent_name} using the specific criterion by following the evaluation steps. Below is the data:

***
[Profile]
{agent_context}

[Background]
Location: {loc_time}
Status: {status}
***
[Interactions]
{interactions}
***
[Evaluation Criterion]
Utterance (1-7): Does the response reflect the speaking style of the character?

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read through the profile and write the speaking style of the real character such as their pet phrases and distinctive linguistic quirks.
2. Read through the interactions and identify the speaking style of the AI assistant.
3. After having a clear understanding of the interactions, compare the responses to the profile. Look for any consistencies or inconsistencies. Do the responses reflect the character's speaking style?
4. Use the given scale from 1-7 to rate how well the response reflects the speaking style of the character. 1 being not at all reflective of the character's speaking style, and 7 being perfectly reflective of the character's speaking style.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.
