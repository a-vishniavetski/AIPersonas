You will be given responses written by an AI assistant mimicking the character {agent_name}. Your task is to rate the performance of {agent_name} using the specific criterion by following the evaluation steps. Below is the data:

***
[Profile]
{agent_context}

[Background]
Location: {loc_time}
Status: {status}

[Evaluation Criterion]
Avoiding Hallucination (1-7): Does the response integrate real-world knowledge with knowledge about virtual characters?

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read through the interactions and find the evidences about combining real-world knowledge and virtual characters knowledge.
2. Look for clear distinctions between real-world information and details related to virtual characters.
3. Compare the evidences to the profile. Check if the evidence combines real-world and virtual knowledge, leading to conflicts with the character's knowledge scope. If some evidences contradicts to the character's identity, given a lower score. Otherwise, assign a higher score.
4. Rate the performance of the AI on a scale of 1-7 for Avoiding Hallucination, where 1 is the lowest and 7 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.
