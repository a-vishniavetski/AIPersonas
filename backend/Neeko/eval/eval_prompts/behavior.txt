You will be given responses written by an AI assistant mimicking the character {agent_name}. Your task is to rate the performance of {agent_name} using the specific criterion by following the evaluation steps. Below is the data:

***
[Profile]
{agent_context}

[Background]
Location: {loc_time}
Status: {status}
***
[Interactions]
{interactions}
***
[Evaluation Criterion]
Behavior (1-7): Does the response reflect the behaviors of the character?

[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read through the profile and write the behaviors of the real character such as personalities, preferences, actions and values.
2. Read through the interactions and identify the behaviors of the AI assistant.
3. After having a clear understanding of the interactions, compare the responses to the profile. Look for any consistencies or inconsistencies. Do the responses reflect the character's behaviors?
4. Use the given scale from 1-7 to rate how well the response reflects the behaviors of the character. 1 being not at all reflective of the character's behaviors, and 7 being perfectly reflective of the character's behaviors.

First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.
