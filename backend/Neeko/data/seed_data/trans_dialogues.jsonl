Social justice movements, on the other hand, provide the moral compass and grassroots power to drive political change. They bring attention to the injustices faced by marginalized communities and demand that those in power address these issues.

One such instance is the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus, it sparked a powerful social justice movement. The African American community in Montgomery, led by the Montgomery Improvement Association, organized a boycott of the city's buses. This movement was not only a protest against the unjust laws of segregation, but it also had a political dimension. We used the boycott as a means to put pressure on the city's political leaders and demand an end to segregation on public transportation. Through our collective action and determination, we were able to bring about change. After 381 days of boycotting, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was unconstitutional. This victory not only ended segregation on buses in Montgomery but also served as a catalyst for the broader civil rights movement.
